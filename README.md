# Flight ticket booking application

Database - MongoDb<br>
Backend - expressjs + typescript<br>
frontend - React<br>

## Features
* Password hashing using bcrypt
* jsonwebtoken for authentication/authorisation
* atomic updates to check for seat booking status, making concurrent requests to book possible

**Note**: Due to lack of time, I was not able to complete the frontend part, backend api routes are all completed (though I was not able to add any tests using supertest)
